# Twitter API - Tinkerhub WIT Mini Hackathon
**Exemplo**<br><br>
We frequently miss out oppurtunities that are there in front of us simply because we did not receive the proper information at the appropriate moment. This is the problem that we tried to address here by creating Exemplo, a twitter bot. Whenever a new event is happening around you, Exemplo will send a tweet to notify you. No more late notifications!

## Link to Twitter bot
[@Exempl_o](https://twitter.com/Exempl_o)

## How it works
* Initially, a link to the twitter account was made using Tweepy package, which is an easy-to-use Python library for accessing the Twitter API.
* Data from [Clist website](https://clist.by/) is used. Whenever a new event is updated in the website, it should appear as a new tweet. 
* [Clist](https://clist.by/) provided an API to access the data from their site. The data response fetched using the API was converted to json format.
